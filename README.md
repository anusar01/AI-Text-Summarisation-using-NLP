## Web Document Text Summarization System (Python)

This project implements a web document text summarization system using Python. It utilizes various techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) to create concise and informative summaries of web documents.

Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities:

**Data Processing:**

* **Data Extraction and Splitting:** The system can extract text content from web documents. This extracted text is then split into smaller units like sentences for further processing.
* **Efficient Retrieval with ChromaDB:** Extracted and processed data is stored in ChromaDB, a high-performance database designed for efficient retrieval. This ensures fast access to relevant information when summarizing new documents.

**Summarization Techniques:**

* **Leveraging LLM Models:** The system utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like Cohere and RAG for summarization. These models are trained on massive datasets of text and code, allowing them to capture complex relationships within the text and generate accurate summaries.

**Underlying Technologies:**

* **Information Retrieval (IR):** Concepts from IR are used to identify the most relevant and informative parts of a document for summarization.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP techniques are employed to understand the structure and meaning of the extracted text.
* **Networking:** The system interacts with web servers to access and download documents for processing.

**Implementation Details:**

* **LangChain:** This framework provides a structured way to combine different NLP components like tokenization and sentence splitting.
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This technique leverages retrieved information from ChromaDB to enhance the summarization process.
* **LLM Models:** Pre-trained LLM models like Cohere or RAG are integrated to generate summaries based on the processed text.


This project demonstrates the power of combining various NLP and IR concepts with advanced LLM models to create a robust and informative web document text summarization system.
